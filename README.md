## Wordle : A Word-Guessing Game

Wordle is a free online game where players guess a five-letter word in six tries.
After each guess, letters are colored green, yellow, or gray to indicate whether they are in the correct position, present but misplaced, or absent in the target word.

## How to Play

1. **Enter a five-letter word**: Type in any five-letter word (via the on-screen keyboard or your device's keyboard) and press Enter. Please note that the guessed word must be an actual word otherwise you will receive an alert message.

2. **Check the tile colors**: The color of each letter's box will change after you make a guess:

- ‚úÖGreen: This letter is in the correct position.

- üü®Yellow: This letter is in the word, but in the wrong position.

- ‚¨õGray: This letter is not in the word at all.

The on-screen keyboard will also color wrong letters

3. **Repeat steps 2 and 3**: Make another guess based on the color clues from your previous guess. You have six total guesses to guess the correct word.
   If you don't guess the word correctly after the 6 attempts, you lose the game. ‚òπÔ∏è
